## Overview

The `codex-slowdown` script enhances the realism of vehicle interactions in FiveM roleplay by slowing down vehicles when their tires are shot. It also includes a feature to log these events to a Discord channel via a webhook, with a configurable system to prevent spam and provide clear, actionable information.

## Features

- **Vehicle Speed Reduction**: Automatically reduces the speed of a vehicle to a specified limit (e.g., 5 km/h) when any tire is shot.
